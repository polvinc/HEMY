> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** The original SWB-003 shaft coupling is not compatible with any shaft we found, particularly this one. Therefore, I designed the CNC part A13 (could be printed, not tested) to replace the original shaft coupling. Another solution is to grind the shaft to increase the flat surface. In fact, the original coupler has a flat spot 4mm away from the opposite edge, whereas the flattened shaft from AliExpress has its flat spot 4.5mm away. In this case it is necessary to grind to 0.5mm.

For metric threads like M2, M3, etc., the pitch is standardized. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines the standards for metric screw threads, which include specifications for thread pitch.


* Note 1 : Here are the metric thread sizes and their standard coarse pitches you shall comply with :
   * M2: Typically has a pitch of 0.4 mm.
   * M2.5: Typically has a pitch of 0.45 mm.
   * M3: Typically has a pitch of 0.5 mm.
   * M4: Typically has a pitch of 0.7 mm.
   * M5: Typically has a pitch of 0.8 mm.
   * M6: Typically has a pitch of 1.0 mm.
   * M8: Typically has a pitch of 1.25 mm.
   * M10: Typically has a pitch of 1.5 mm.
* Note 2 :
   The dimensions of a "Chamfered plain washer M2" are generally standardized to ensure compatibility with M2 screws and bolts. Standardization helps ensure that washers from different manufacturers can be used interchangeably. Here are the typical dimensions for an M2 chamfered plain washer:
  
   * Inner Diameter (ID): Approximately 2.2 mm to fit an M2 screw.
   * Outer Diameter (OD): Typically around 5 mm, though this can vary slightly depending on the specific standard or manufacturer.
   * Thickness: Usually around 0.5 mm, but this can also vary slightly.
