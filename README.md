<!-- > _"When astronomy meets DIY and open source, accessible tools are born to explore the universe."_  
> — polvinc -->

**HEMY v2** is an open-source equatorial/alt-azimuth telescope mount designed for passionate astrophotographers and visual observers. Built around **harmonic drive technology**, HEMY offers high precision, portability, and affordability — without compromising on performance.

It is the result of a collaborative and iterative development effort to deliver a powerful, open-source alternative to proprietary commercial mounts.

## 🚀 Project Description

**HEMY (Harmonic Equatorial Mount Yourself)** is a DIY telescope mount based on industrial-grade **harmonic reducers**, typically used in robotics. These reducers enable compact, backlash-free motion with high torque — ideal for precise astronomical tracking.

The project was created to address key issues in amateur astronomy equipment:
- High prices of commercial mounts
- Lack of openness and flexibility
- Complexity or incompatibility with personal setups

HEMY is:
- 🧰 **Cost-effective** – Total build cost under **800–1000 €**, with machined parts available for less than 400 €
- 🪶 **Portable & lightweight** – Less than 4 kg without base
- 🏗️ **Easy to build** – Designed for makers with basic tools
- 💪 **High-performance** – Accurate tracking (sub-arcsecond RMS), no counterweights needed


⚠️ **Important note about current status** ⚠️

This project is under continuous development. Initial performance tests are promising (13 kg and guiding <1 arcsec) and updates will be published regularly.

## 🙌 Credits and support

Made with curiosity, solder fumes, and a deep love for the stars.  
By [@polvinc](https://github.com/polvinc). Inspirations from the open-source astro community.

### Why Support?
The development of HEMY V2 represents thousands of hours of work, research, and development. The journey involved:
- Multiple prototypes and iterations
- Extensive testing and validation
- Many failed attempts that led to improvements
- Significant personal investment in components and materials
- Countless nights of testing under the stars

While HEMY is open-source and free to use, the development process has been costly. Each iteration required new parts, and the path to the current successful design involved many expensive learning experiences.

Help me out for a couple of :beers: !

## Bill of Materials (BOM)


See [BOM.md](docs/v2/BOM.md).

### Total Estimated Cost: ~$800 without base

There are two possibilities for the alt/az base of the mount: either the HEMY v1 base, or the poxisky base which is very well sized for the project and less expensive.

Note: Prices are approximate and may vary depending on supplier and location.

## 🔌 Electronics Overview

The electronics system of **HEMY v2** is fully custom-designed and built around a compact stack of modular PCBs. It includes:

- A main control board based on the **Teensy 4.0 MicroMod** running [OnStepX](https://github.com/hjd1964/OnStepX)
- Two **TMC5160 stepper drivers** for precise, silent microstepping
- An optional **brake driver** for locking the RA axis when idle
- A **LilyGO T-01 C3** Wi-Fi module for remote control via web or INDI
- Integrated **GPS** with PPS, power passthrough, and USB routing

All boards were designed using open-source tools and are published on [OSHWHub – HEMY 2.0 project](https://oshwlab.com/pololamag/hemy-2-0), where you can view the schematics, order PCBs, or remix them to fit your needs.

> 🧠 The electronics stack is plug-and-play compatible with the mechanical mount and was developed specifically to minimize wiring, improve modularity, and enable clean integration into astrophotography workflows.
